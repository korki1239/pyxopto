Simulator options
=================

Simulator options are used to customize the OpenCL kernel. All kernel
options are derived from the :py:class:`xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McOption` class.
The boolean options are implemented
by subclassing :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McBoolOption`,
the integer options
by subclassing :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McIntOption`,
the floating-point
options by subclassing :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McFloatOption` and
the data type options
by subclassing :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McTypeOption`.

The :py:mod:`xopto.mcbase.mcoptions` is also conveniently imported into the
:py:mod:`xopto.mcvox.mc` and :py:mod:`xopto.mcvox.mcoptions` modules.

The list of available options is as follows:

* :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McMethod`
  (default is :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McMethod.albedo_weight`) -
  can be used to set the Monte Carlo method. A detailed description of the
  methods can be found in:

  #. A. Sassaroli and F. Martelli, *Equivalence of four Monte Carlo*
     *methods for photon migration in turbid media*,
     J Opt Soc Am A Opt Image Sci Vis, **29** (10), 2110-2117 (2012),
     https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.29.002110.

  Three different photon packet stepping methods are available:

    - Albedo Rejection
      (:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McMethod.albedo_rejection`
      or :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McMethod.ar`)

      Propagation step :math:`s=-\frac{\ln(\xi_1)}{\mu_t}` is derived
      from a uniform random number :math:`\xi_1` from interval
      :math:`[0, 1]` and the total attenuation coefficient
      :math:`\mu_t=\mu_a + \mu_s`, which is the sum of the absorption
      :math:`\mu_a` and scattering coefficients :math:`\mu_s`.
      The packet is fully absorbed if no boundaries are
      hit along the step :math:`s` and a uniform random number
      :math:`\xi_2` from :math:`[0, 1]` fulfils
      :math:`\xi_2 \leq \frac{\mu_a}{\mu_t}`.  If the
      packet hits a geometry boundary, it is propagated up to the boundary,
      where the boundary interactions are processed and a new propagation
      step is started afterwards.

    - Albedo weight
      (:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McMethod.albedo_weight`
      or :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McMethod.aw`)

      Propagation step :math:`s=-\frac{\ln(\xi_1)}{\mu_t}` is derived
      from a uniform random number :math:`\xi_1` from interval
      :math:`[0, 1]` and the total attenuation coefficient
      :math:`\mu_t=\mu_a + \mu_s`, which is the sum of the absorption
      :math:`\mu_a` and scattering coefficients :math:`\mu_s`.
      The packet is scattered and partially absorbed if no boundaries are
      hit along the step :math:`s`. The fraction of the absorbed
      weight is computed as :math:`\frac{\mu_a}{\mu_t}`. If the
      packet hits a geometry boundary, it is propagated up to the boundary,
      where the boundary interactions are processed and a new propagation
      step is started afterwards.

    - Microscopic Beer-Lambert
      (:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McMethod.microscopic_beer_lambert`
      or :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McMethod.mbl`)

      Propagation step :math:`s=-\frac{\ln(\xi_1)}{\mu_s}` is derived
      from a uniform random number :math:`\xi_1` from interval
      :math:`[0, 1]` and the scattering coefficient :math:`\mu_s`.
      The packet is absorbed according to the traveled path regardless
      if a boundary is hit along the step.  If the packet hits a geometry
      boundary, it is propagated up to the boundary, where the boundary
      interactions are processed and a new propagation step is
      started afterwards. The fraction of the absorbed
      weight is computed as :math:`1 - \exp^{-\mu_a s_b}`, where
      :math:`s_b` is the distance along the current propagation direction
      to the nearest boundary or the full step if no boundaries are hit.

  The Albedo Rejection implementation of the Monte Carlo method is the fastest
  but produces the noisiest results, since only the full energy of the photon
  packet is deposited or collected by the detectors.

  The Microscopic Beer-Lambert method produces the best quality fluence or
  Energy Deposition simulations if the size of the voxels in
  the deposition / fluence grid is smaller than the
  mean free path of the packets, i.e. there is on average less than one
  absorption event per traversal of a fluence voxel.

  The default Albedo Weight method is recommended for reflectance simulations.
  It also matches the energy deposition performance of the Microscopic
  Beer-Lambert method if the mean free path is equal or smaller
  than the voxel size of the deposition / fluence grid, i.e. there is on
  average at least one deposition event per voxel traversal.

* :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McUseFluenceCache`
  (default is :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McUseFluenceCache.off`) - 
  can be used to enable software cache for the fluence accumulator.
  Fluence cache will improve performance for configuration of deposition
  voxels, where there is a high likelihood that consecutive weight depositions
  will go into the same fluence accumulator or where the global memory
  bandwidth presents the main performance limiting factor.
* :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McUseNativeMath`
  (default is :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McUseNativeMath.off`) -
  can be used to enable half-precision math functions. Half-precision
  usually gives some performance benefit, but at a significantly reduced
  precision. Use this option with care! The half-precision math and native math
  :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McUseNativeMath` options are
  mutually excluding. Ony one of the two options can be enabled at any
  given time. If both options are enabled, the native math option takes
  precedence.
* :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McUseHalfMath`
  (default is :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McUseHalfMath.off`) -
  can be used to enable device-native math functions. Native math usually gives
  some performance benefit, but might not be fully compliant with precisions
  defined by the IEEE standards.
  The half-precision math :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McUseHalfMath`
  and native math options are mutually excluding. Ony one of the two options
  can be enabled at any given time. If both options are enabled, the native
  math option takes precedence.

* :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McMaterialMemory`
  (default is :py:attr:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McMaterialMemory.global_mem`) -
  OpenCL memory type used to store the array of materials.
  Selecting :py:attr:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McIntLutMemory.constant_mem` memory
  will likely lead to a performance boost, in particular on
  older GPUs. However, note that the amount of available constant
  (:py:attr:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McIntLutMemory.constant_mem`)
  memory on GPUs is typically limited to about 64k. The constant memory is
  also used to hold some performance-critical simulator data and can be also
  used to hold lookup table data of integer or floating-point type.

* :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McIntLutMemory`
  (default is :py:attr:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McIntLutMemory.constant_mem`) -
  OpenCL memory type used to hold the integer type lookup table data.
  Selecting :py:attr:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McIntLutMemory.global_mem` memory
  will likely lead to a significant performance degradation, in particular on
  older GPUs. Note that the amount of available "constant_mem" memory on GPUs is
  typically limited to about 64k.

* :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McFloatLutMemory`
  (default is :py:attr:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McFloatLutMemory.constant_mem`) -
  OpenCL memory type used to hold the floating-point type lookup table data.
  Selecting :py:attr:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McFloatLutMemory.global_mem` memory
  will likely lead to a significant performance degradation, in particular on
  older GPUs. Note that the amount of available "constant_mem" memory on GPUs is
  typically limited to about 64 |nbsp| kB.

* :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McDebugMode`
  (default is :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McDebugMode.off`) -
  Can be used to enable kernel debug mode that will print information to
  the console output. Note that this mode requires printf functionality in
  the  OpenCL kernel that might not be supported by all OpenCL devices.
  If this mode is turned on :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McDebugMode.on`,
  run the Monte Carlo simulator with one or a small number of photon packets.

* :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McUseSoft64Atomics`
  (default is :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McUseSoft64Atomics.off`) -
  Can be used to force software implementation of 64-bit atomic operations.

* :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McUseLottery`
  (default is :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McUseSoft64Atomics.on`) -
  Can be used to disable termination of photon packets through lottery.

* :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McMinimumPacketWeight`
  (default is 10 :superscript:`-4`) -
  Sets the minimum photon packet weight allowed before starting packet
  termination or lottery.

* :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McPacketLotteryChance`
  (default is 0.1) -
  Terminate photon packet by lottery if the value of a uniform random
  number from [0, 1] exceeds this value.

* :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McUsePackedStructures`
  (default is :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcoptions.McUsePackedStructures.off`) -
  Can be used to force tightly packed structures in the OpenCL code.
  Note that packed structures can lead to significant performance
  degradation of the Monte Carlo kernel. This option is the last resort if
  the fields of the OpenCL and host structures cannot be properly aligned.
  When declaring OPenCL or host structures always start with the
  largest data type and move towards smaller data types. Use data types
  that are of size no less than 4 bytes.
