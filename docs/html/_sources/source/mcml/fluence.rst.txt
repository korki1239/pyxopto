Fluence
=======

Fluence detector is used to obtain the spatial distribution of the
energy (packet weights) deposited into the sample through the process of
absorption or optionally the fluence rate.
Three different implementations of the fluence detector are
available in the :py:mod:`xopto.mcbase.mcfluence` module:

* :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.FluenceRz` - Radially symmetric implementation :math:`(r, z)`.
* :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.FluenceCyl` - Implementation in cylindrical coordinates :math:`(r, \varphi, z)`. 
* :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.Fluence` - Implementation in Cartesian coordinates :math:`(x, y, z)`.


The observed volume voxelization is axis-aligned and allows independent
adjustment of the voxel size along the x, y and z axis for
:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.Fluence`, along r, Ï† and z axis for .
:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.FluenceCyl` and along the r and z axis for
:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.FluenceRz`.

The :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.FluenceRz`,
:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.FluenceCyl` and
:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.FluenceRz` classes are also conveniently
imported into the :py:mod:`xopto.mcml.mcfluence` and
:py:mod:`xopto.mcvox.mcfluence` modules.

The fluence detector allows collection of unscaled deposited / absorbed
packet weights or of the fluence rate where the deposited packet weights are
scaled by the inverse of the absorption coefficient. The collection method can
be selected through the :python:`mode` argument that should be set
to :python:`'deposition'` (default) for the raw weights and :python:`'fluence'`
for the fluence rate.

In the following example we voxelize a volume that extends along the
x axis from -5 to 5 |nbsp| mm, along the y axis from -5 to 5 |nbsp| mm and along
the z axis from 0 to 10 |nbsp| mm. The voxel size along all the three axis is
set to 0.1 |nbsp| mm.

.. code-block:: python

    from xopto.mcml import mc

    fluence = mc.mcfluence.Fluence(
        xaxis=mc.mcfluence.Axis(-5.0e-3, 5.0e-3, 100),
        yaxis=mc.mcfluence.Axis(-5.0e-3, 5.0e-3, 100),
        zaxis=mc.mcfluence.Axis(0.0, 10.0e-3, 100)
    )

The :py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcutil.axis.Axis` instances along the x, y and z
axis can be accessed through the 
:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.Fluence.xaxis`,
:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.Fluence.yaxis` and
:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.Fluence.zaxis` properties. Likewise, the
centers of the voxels along the x, y and z axis can be accessed through the
:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.Fluence.x`,
:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.Fluence.y` and
:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.Fluence.z` properties.

.. code-block:: python

    xaxis = fluence.xaxis
    yaxis = fluence.yaxis
    zaxis = fluence.zaxis

    x_centers = fluence.x    # or as xaxis.centers
    y_centers = fluence.y    # or as yaxis.centers
    z_centers = fluence.z    # or as zaxis.centers

The fluence data are stored in a 3D numpy array that can be accessed through the
:py:attr:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.Fluence.raw` or
:py:attr:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.Fluence.data` properties. The individual
voxels are addressed / sliced as :python:`data[z_slice, y_slice, x_slice]`.
Note that the values returned by the
:py:attr:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.Fluence.raw` property are the unscaled
sums of deposited / absorbed photon packet weights while the values returned by
the :py:attr:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.Fluence.data` property are scaled by the
inverse of the product between the voxel volume and the number of launched
packets. Also note that the voxel size is constant for the
:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.Fluence` but changes with location for the
:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.FluenceRz` and
:py:class:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.FluenceCyl`.


After completing the Monte Carlo simulation, the fluence accumulator can be
viewed using the :py:meth:`~xopto.mcbase.mcfluence.Fluence.plot` method. The
method allows slicing across the voxelized volume along one of the main
coordinate axis. Use the :code:`axis` parameter to set the coordinate
axis:

* :python:`axis='x'` slice along the x axis,
* :python:`axis='y'` slice along the y axis,
* :python:`axis='z'` slice along the z axis.

To show integral projections along one of the main coordinate axis call with:

* :python:`axis='xproj'` for an integral projection along the x axis,
* :python:`axis=yproj` for an integral projection along the y axis,
* :python:`axis='zproj'` for an integral projection along the z axis.


The slices can be viewed in a linear or logarithmic scale. Call with
:python:`scale='lin'` to show the slices in a linear intensity scale.
By default the color coding of each slice is automatically scaled to the range
of weights (:python:`autoscale=True`). 

.. code-block:: python

    fluence.plot(axis='z')    # slice along the z axis
    fluence.plot(axis='y')    # slice along the y axis
    fluence.plot(axis='x')    # slice along the x axis

    fluence.plot(axis='zproj')    # integral projection / sum along the z axis
    fluence.plot(axis='yproj')    # integral projection / sum along the y axis
    fluence.plot(axis='xproj')    # integral projection / sum along the x axis
